This file exists because commit messages are too small.

1. Collection.js, i think this is a test file? No harm in keeping, but no harm in deleting either.

2. All 'vars' i found were changed to let's or consts, var is just nasty imo

3. Index.js was broken up into several files in order to increase readability and allow for reloading.

Silver.js - Main bot file, contains loging, and client creation, as well as the require for the event loader

Eventloader.js - Main event handler, takes the client then splits it amongst the events as they are called.

Message.js - Message event file
Ready.js - Ready event file
guildMemberSpeaking - speaking file

Removed mkdir function, pointless
Removed delete function, use fs.unlinksync instead of callbacks

I actually stopped paying attention to what i was doing tbh...

I pulled some old code i had from my own music bot to streamline finding videos also started the basis for storing all sorts 
of info about the video for display purposes.

In general what I did was give you a preview of a more broken up version of your bot which is a little more readable
as well as more workable with reloading and such.
